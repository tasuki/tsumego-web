description: It is a matter of life and death,
             a road either to safety or to ruin.
             Hence it is a subject of inquiry
             which can on no account be neglected.

			### 2024 update

			Website hopefully slightly less bad on small devices. Also fewer
			resources and absolutely no JavaScript. Goodbye Twitter Bootstrap!

			### 2018 anniversary update

			Hey yo, all the books have gotten refreshed for 2018: better
			layout, nicer wording, vectorized mobile version.

			### Collections

			*Cho Chikun's Encyclopedia of Life and Death* is a wonderful
			progression which will take you **from an absolute beginner to mid
			dan level**.

			Next, we present you with the three **most famous classical tsumego
			collections**. *Gokyo Shumyo* deals mostly with patterns occuring
			often in real games. *XuanXuan Qijing* focuses on feeling and vital
			points, and the insanely difficult *Igo Hatsuyo-ron* is here just
			to make you cry.
