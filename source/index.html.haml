			### Collections

			*Cho Chikun's Encyclopedia of Life and Death* is a wonderful
			progression which will take you **from an absolute beginner to mid
			dan level**.

			Next, we present you with the four **most famous classical tsumego
			collections**. *Lee Chang-ho's* selected problems is
			six-volume series of increasing difficulty.
			*Gokyo Shumyo* deals mostly with patterns occuring
			often in real games. *XuanXuan Qijing* focuses on feeling and vital
			points, and the insanely difficult *Igo Hatsuyo-ron* is here just
			to make you cry.
