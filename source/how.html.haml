			### The books

			Back in 2004, before I had any idea how to code, I created a
			monster. Started with sgf files containing the problem collections,
			wrote an [awful Perl script][rotate] rotating the problems to the
			upper left corner. (Hey, it's just 100 lines of code and actually
			*does* something. These days I write thousands of lines of code to
			do nothing much at all.)

			Then used sgf2dg (back when it was called sgf2tex!) to spit out TeX
			output.  PdfTeX to get pdfs and voila.

			This would be a good place to thank [Toxygen][toxygen].  Do you
			know how Metafont fonts look when processed with pdfTeX?  Fucking
			ugly. I spent weeks trying to convert the Metafont go diagram fonts
			into PostScript format. Then Majo came along and converted them, I
			still have no idea how he did it. If you ever want to produce go
			pdf's from TeX, get the [PostScript fonts][fonts].

			### The website

			7 years after launch -- 2013 AD -- seems like the right time to
			drop the "Beta" and refresh the website a little. Also a good
			opportunity to finally try out Twitter Bootstrap. And since static
			site generation is all the rage these days and Jekyll is not hip
			enough anymore, it's done with Middleman. You can [see the source
			of the Tsumego Collections website][source] and submit [bug
			reports][bugs].

			Bootstrap sucks, please use [Pure.css][purecss] instead!

			Middleman is aging nicely.
